# My Emacs configuration

This is my `init.el`, which is getting a bit unwieldy now, but I'm still
looking at ways to factor parts out.

After years of using Sam Aaron's [emacs-live](https://www.github.com/overtone/emacs-live)
configuration, I decided to try creating my own from scratch.

My main requirement is to have an effective environment for working with
Clojure, although I'm starting to use it for other languages, such as Elm and
Standard ML.

# Packages

I'll try to keep this in sync with `init.el`, but it might not always be
up-to-date.
